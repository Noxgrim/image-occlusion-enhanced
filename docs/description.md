<!-- BANNER -->

Image Occlusion lets you create cards that **hide parts of an image** to test your knowledge of that hidden information. The cards generated by this add-on would be best described as **image-based cloze-deletions**:

### IMPORTANT

This is a test release of Image Occlusion Enhanced for Anki 2.1. Please make sure to carefully read through this description and familiarize yourself with the official Anki 2.1 change notes notes before giving the add-on a try.

The present AnkiWeb upload is temporary and will be removed in favor of the [regular add-on listing](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094) once testing is complete.

### LIMITATIONS OF THIS ALPHA RELEASE

There are a number of known limitations to this alpha release that you need to be aware of:

- Due to compatibility issues between SVG-Edit and the new Chromium renderer in Anki 2.1 some of the features in the masks editor no longer work correctly. My hope is to address these in the following beta release:
    + [Pointer not changing to selection mode when clicking on shape](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/54)
    + [Path tool no longer working](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/56)
    + [https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/57](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/57)
- Please do not invoke the add-on's settings menu while the I/O Editor is running. There is currently no support for updating I/O editing sessions at runtime, and while most settings will simply only not be applied, others might cause the add-on to stop working correctly until the editor session is restarted. The same applies to modifications to the add-on's note type via Anki's built-in note type manager.

Of course there also bound to be some unforeseen bugs and regressions in the alpha. If you experience any of these please make sure to either report them on the add-on's [bug tracker](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues) or in the [official support thread](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/8295-image-occlusion-enhanced-official-thread). Any and all feedback is appreciated!

### USAGE

The use of this add-on is detailed in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/wiki) and a [series of video tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MozITKTz5YFHDGB19ypxcYfJ1ITk_6o). Please note that most of these resources have yet to be updated for Anki 2.1, and as such might not cover recent releases of the add-on fully.
