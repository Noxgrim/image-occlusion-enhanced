*Image Occlusion Enhanced* is an updated version of *Image Occlusion 2.0*.

Image Occlusion lets you create cards that **hide parts of an image** to test your knowledge of that hidden information. The cards generated by this add-on would be best described as **image-based cloze-deletions**:

**COMPATIBILITY**

This version of Image Occlusion Enhanced only works with Anki's stable release branch (Anki 2.0.x, version 2.0.30 and up). If you are using Anki 2.1, make sure to check out the latest [development release of the add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155).

**CHANGES COMPARED TO IO 2.0**

- **Modify Existing Notes**: Update and modify your IO notes to your heart's content
- **Change Images on the Fly**: Switch to a different image right from the Editor
- **Create Custom Labels**: Your image is lacking a specific label? Now you can create it yourself!
- **Completely Overhauled UI**: Tabs, multi-line entry fields, numerous new hotkey assignments
- **Completely Reworked Note Type**: 4 additional fields, new intuitive field order
- **Updated Card Template**: New card layout, a button to reveal all masks, optimizations for AnkiMobile
- **Full Customization**: Add and rename as many fields as you like
- **Updated Options Interface**: More options, fewer bugs
- **Fully Rewritten Note Generator**: Faster, more extensible, and less bug-prone
- **Performance Improvements**: Smaller memory footprint in general use
- **Stability Improvements**: Bug fixes everywhere
